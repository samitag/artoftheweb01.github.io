Andy is the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Dunder Mifflin Stamford branch. Andy works with fellow salesmen Jim and Karen, under the direction of Josh Porter. Upon the branch's closure, Andy transferred to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch.
<br>
Andy is shown to enjoy inventing nicknames for his colleagues. He nicknamed Jim Halpert "Big Tuna", because he ate a tuna sandwich on his first day at the Stamford branch, and once called Ryan Howard "Big Turkey," presumably for a similar reason.
Prior to his Anger Management training, Andy had severe anger problems. Upon finding his calculator embedded in Jell-O, a trademark prank of Jim's, he screams and kicks a trash can across the office. After punching a hole in the wall of the office, in frustration over his hidden cellphone, Andy is sent to Anger Management training, which he claims is still "Management Training.”
<br>
Andy regularly dresses in a distinctive, over-the-top preppy style, usually consisting of bright colored pants (some embroidered with animals and tennis racquets), d-ring belts, tattersall shirts, sweater vests, striped ties, a tie clip, or sometimes even a bowtie. In various episodes, Andy wears clothes of the style found at the stores Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines, and J. Crew. In various episodes, Andy is seen wearing a blue, thick woven bracelet on his right wrist, despite that it will, at times, clash with his overall appearance.
<br>
During the summer of 2011, Andy is promoted to Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch.[11] However, when he returns to Scranton after a trip to Florida and discovers that Nellie Bertram has replaced him, he goes into a fit of rage.[12] After the incident, he refuses to be demoted, which ultimately leads to Robert California firing him. However, after persuading David Wallace to re-purchase the company, Andy is reinstated as manager. Andy then tells David Wallace that he is going to quit his job, only having second thoughts almost immediately, gets temporarily re hired as a salesman. Then, he quits again to pursue his dream of being an entertainer.
<br>
After embarrassing himself at a singing competition show audition, Andy lands a job in the admissions office at Cornell.
